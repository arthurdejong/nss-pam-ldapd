 -- Arthur de Jong <adejong@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Jun 2007 01:27:52 +0200

nss-ldapd (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * initial release of nss-ldapd (should be functional but not yet stable
    enough for production use)
  * fork from the nss_ldap which was originally written by Luke Howard of PADL
    Software Pty Ltd. changing package name to nss-ldapd and changing

    code was removed) (more simplifications to come)
  * the test code was rewritten

libnss-ldap (251-5.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * When doing substitutions in libnss-ldap.conf, pass the values to the Perl
    program as environment variables instead of directly to the program;
    should eliminate the problems with having to escape them.
    (Closes: #376684, #386141)
  * Change the init script policy. Instead of stopping libnss-ldap.init on
    clean shutdown (touching a file) and starting it after networking (rm-ing
    it), we touch the file in /lib/init/rw as soon as possible (right before
    udev is started, touching a file) and stop it after initial system bootup.
    This fixes both issues with /var being on a separate partition, and
    unclean shutdown where the file would not be created. (To make sure we
    don't get similar problems during shutdown, we create it in runlevels 0
    and 6 as before, but we don't assume it's still there when we boot, since
    it's on a tmpfs now.) (Closes: #375077)
  * Block SIGPIPE in do_atfork_child(), as some versions of libldap2 in some
    circumstances (notably with TLS enabled) write data onto our dummy socket
    during close, which raises a SIGPIPE that should not be delivered on to the
    application. (Closes: #376426, #388574)

 -- Stephen Frost <sfrost@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Jun 2006 14:53:29 -0400

libnss-ldap (251-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added system which implicitly sets bind_policy to 'soft'
    during system boot/shutdown.  This is implemented by an
    init script run at end of system boot and start of system
    shutdown which creates/removes a file in /var/lib/libnss-ldap
    called 'bind_policy_soft'.  When this file exists the policy
    is treated as 'soft' regardless of the configuration in
    /etc/nss-ldap.conf.  Note that soft doesn't mean 'always
    fail' but rather only try to connect to each URI listed in
    the configuration file once, with no sleeping.
