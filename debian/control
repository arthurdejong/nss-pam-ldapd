Description: Daemon for NSS and PAM lookups using LDAP
 This package provides a daemon for retrieving user account, and other
 system information from LDAP.
 .
 It is used by the libnss-ldapd and libpam-ldapd packages but by itself is
 not very useful.

Description: NSS module for using LDAP as a naming service
 This package provides a Name Service Switch module that allows your LDAP
 server to provide user account, group, host name, alias, netgroup, and
 basically any other information that you would normally get from /etc flat
 files or NIS.
 .
 This is a fork from libnss-ldap implementing structural design changes
 to fix, amongst other things, problems related to host name lookups and
 name lookups during booting.

Description: PAM module for using LDAP as an authentication service
 This package provides a Pluggable Authentication Module that allows
 user authentication based on credentials stored in an LDAP server.
 .
 This module is still under development but strives to be able to replace
 the libpam-ldap package in most cases.
