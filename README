LDAP NAMESERVICE SWITCH LIBRARY
===============================

This is the nss_ldap library, an LDAP module for the Solaris Nameservice
Switch (NSS), the GNU libc NSS, and the ISC BIND IRS (used on BSDI
and IRS).

The LDAP schema used is described in RFC 2307

Insert this:

passwd:     files nis ldap
group:      files nis ldap

or something similar in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

The source code is distributed under the GNU General Library Public Licence
(see COPYING.LIB). 

Platforms this has been built under:

	o Linux 2.x
	o Solaris 2.4, 2.6, 7, 8
	o FreeBSD BIND 8.x (not useful unless you recompile libc)
	o AIX 4.3.3 with IRS

If you are willing to use an older, and possibly buggy, version
of nss_ldap, you *might* find patches to get it to work with the
"real" FreeBSD nsswitch at http://www.nectar.com/freebsd/nsswitch.

To install:

% ./configure
% make
% make install

NB: you need to use GNU make! (often called gmake or gnumake)

1. Installation
---------------

You need to ensure libnss_ldap.so.1 (or nss_ldap.so.1, for Solaris) is in
/usr/lib.

2. Building shared LDAP client libraries
----------------------------------------

You can build a position independent LDAP client library by compiling
-fPIC and linking with -shared, or downloading the Mozilla or Netscape
LDAP SDKs. Note that OpenLDAP only appears to build shared libraries
on some platforms (apparently not Solaris?). To build these, configure
with --enable-shared.

Q: Using the Netscape LDAP library with pam_ldap on Solaris 8
- aka Solaris 2.8 - fails to link properly! David Begley writes:

There are two releases of the Netscape LDAP library, one marked
for Solaris 8 and the other marked for Solaris 2.6 - the additional
catch is that the Solaris 8 library is a 64-bit library (this is marked
on Netscape's site) whilst the other is a 32-bit library.

It doesn't matter if you have a 64-bit UltraSPARC processor running
the 64-bit Solaris kernel, if your compiler only works with 32-bit
objects then it won't successfully link the 64-bit Solaris 8
Netscape LDAP library.

GCC (up to version 2.95.2) does not work properly with 64-bit objects
under Solaris, so just use the Solaris 2.6 (32-bit) Netscape LDAP
library and everything should be fine.

Q: Can I use a third-party client LDAP library (such as Netscape's)
on Solaris 7? David Begley writes:

Yes, but if you have the Solaris 7 LDAP library installed (package
SUNWlldap or SUNWldapx) configure will find it before the third-party
library - in this case, you can't rely on the auto-lib-type detection of
configure and must use the "--with-ldap-lib=" parameter.

Q: Why does linking fail on Solaris 2.6 (complaining about
relocations remaining against libcrypt)? David Begley
writes:

In short, the problem is that GCC is looking for a shared libcrypt
(in response to the "--shared" parameter) which doesn't exist on
Solaris 2.6 (but does on Solaris 7).  The fix is quite simple, use
"-G" instead of "--shared" (could this be a GCC bug?).  This change
should already be included in newer versions of pam_ldap.

It doesn't look like libcrypt is even needed if you're using the
Netscape LDAP client library (maybe it's required for OpenLDAP?).

Scott M. Stone <sstone@foo3.com> writes:
Your openldap libs *and* your SSL/RSAREF libs must be DYNAMIC LIBRARIES
or neither nss_ldap nor pam_ldap will work.  

3. glibc 2.0 compatibility
--------------------------

Current versions of the nss_ldap library are designed to work with
glibc 2.1, not glibc 2.0. They _may_ work with glibc 2.0. YMMV.

4. RFC2307BIS
-------------

Compiling with -DRFC2307BIS adds rfc2307bis support, which at the
moment just gets you support for groups with distinguished name
members (instead of login names). A posixGroup can thus have the
both memberUid and uniqueMember attributes.

5. Building under FreeBSD
-------------------------

Here's what I do to build it under FreeBSD. You will need to
link it into libbind.a for it actually to be useful.

CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/bind -DPIC"
export CPPFLAGS
CFLAGS=$CPPFLAGS # this is weird
export CFLAGS
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
LIBS="-lbind_r -lgnuregex -lsasl -lkrb"
export LDFLAGS LIBS
./configure
make

6. Solaris, shadowAccount
-------------------------

7. Secret file
--------------

If using /etc/ldap.secret, it must have a newline at the end
of the secret.

8. Mailing lists
----------------

To discuss nss_ldap and related technologies, you may
subscribe to the following mailing lists:    

        <URL:mailto:nssldap-request@padl.com>
and
        <URL:mailto:ldap-nis-request@padl.com>

Send an electronic mail message with "subscribe" in the
message body to join the list.

9. Commercial support
---------------------

Note that PADL now offer commercial support on a
per-incident basis.      

To request a support incident, send email to: nssldap-support@padl.com
